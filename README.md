# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict bike rental demand based on factors such as weather, time of day, day of the week, and seasonal trends. The model helps bike-sharing companies optimize inventory, reduce shortages, and improve user satisfaction.

## Features
- Predict daily/hourly bike rentals using historical data.
- Analyze impact of weather, holidays, and seasons on demand.
- Generate insights for operational and strategic decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Timestamp (hour/day)
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind)
- Holiday/working day indicators
- Number of bike rentals (target variable)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url># Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
